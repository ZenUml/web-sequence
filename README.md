## CI/CD

### Staging environment

1. When a PR is created or updated, a **preview** site will be created, and you can find the link in the PR page.
2. When a PR is merged into `master` branch, a **staging** site will be created. The link to the staging site is https://staging.zenuml.com.

### Production environment

Create a tag as `release-<version>`, and push it to the remote. It doesn't matter which branch you are on. The CI/CD
pipeline will create a production release. The link to the production site is https://app.zenuml.com.
