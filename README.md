**Web Sequence** is a Chrome Extension and a Web App that convert your Chrome tab into a sequence diagram generator. Something like CodePen or JSFiddle, but for sequence diagram generation.

### [Go to Web App](https://app.zenuml.com)

##Deployment

We will discuss deployment of the following items:

| App/Plugin       | Target    | Local | Console | Travis-CI |
|------------------|-----------|-------|---------|-----------|
| Web App          | Firebase  | Y     | N       | Y         |
| Functions        | Firebase  | Y     | N       | N         |
| Chrome extension | Web store | Y     | Y       | N         |


### Web App and Chrome extension

Shared steps - build and test:

1. Make sure you are on the right branch (`master`).
1. `yarn install` to install the dependencies
1. `yarn build` to build the product release
1. `yarn release` to copy build files to app / extension
1. `http-server ./app` to verify build in ./app
1. `access localhost instead of 127.0.0.1` to allow firebase access

#### Chrome extension
1. Update `version` in `extension/manifest.json`
1. Zip the `extension` folder
1. `yarn upload` to upload the extension to Google Web Store
1. `yarn pub` to publish the extension

> Optimisation: The #3 step in the shared steps would generate a zip file. The #2 step can be omitted if 
we pass the generated zip file name to the script of `yarn upload` and `yarn pub`.

##### Post deployment

1. Uninstall and reinstall [the latest version of extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-sequence/kcpganeflmhffnlofpdmcjklmdpbbmef)
1. Do smoke test by creating a new diagram

#### Web App

##### From local
````
// firebase.json, this will deploy the `app` folder
$ firebase deploy --project [staging|prod]
````

##### Post development

1. Go to [the page of app](https://app.zenuml.com)
2. Do smoke test by create a new diagram

### Development

#### First time setup

````
$ yarn install  // instal modules
$ yarn start    // start a local server

$ yarn build    // build a staging release
$ yarn build-prod    // build a production release
$ gulp release  // copy resources to app / extension
````

#### Enable/Disable DEBUG

In Chrome console, type in `document.cookie='DEBUG=true'` or `document.cookie='DEBUG=;max-age=1'`.

````
$ yarn link vue-sequence # use un-uglyfied version
$ webpack                # build bundle.js to src/lib
````
