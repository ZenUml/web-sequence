			<h2>Can I use the application commercially?</h2>

			<p>Yes. Feel free to use it commercially as long as it is a fair use. It is a fair use as long as it is not an intentional attack to the site.
                To be clear,</p>

			<p>1. All the code (ZenUML DSL and CSS) written by you is owned by you (and/or your organisation); they will be stored locally to your browser, and in the cloud on firebase if you choose to log in.</p>
            <p>2. All the generated images from your code are owned by you (and/or your organisation); they are exported to your device and not stored anywhere within the application. </p>
            <p>3. All content generated by you before is owned by you (and/or your organisation). </p>
            <p>4. ZenUML has the right to terminate its service. We will publish a notice on this site 1 month before the end date. We do not intend to do so at anytime soon.</p>

			<h2>What if I have concerns of my data? </h2>

			<p>We have privacy policy that describes how your data is stored and processed. You may also would like to use one of the following approaches: </p>
			<p>1. Host it by yourself. The code for the site is released under MIT license on GitHub (https://github.com/ZenUml/web-sequence). If you need any help, please let me know. </p>
			<p>2. Use the confluence plugin. This tool stores all the content you created within the Confluence pages. </p>
			<p>3. Build your own solution. Here is an example - https://codesandbox.io/s/5v4v78w1wk . It is using the same library as our site and other applications.</p>
